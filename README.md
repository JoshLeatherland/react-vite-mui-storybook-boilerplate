Setting up a new repository has often been a time-consuming process for me. By the time I configured everything, hours would have passed, delaying my progress. Most of my projects involve Material UI, Storybook, or i18n, so I created this boilerplate to streamline the setup for future projects. Feel free to use it too!

## Features

- **NPM Workspaces**: Take advantage of NPM workspaces to easily scale and manage your project.
- **Material-UI Component Library**: Includes a curated set of Material-UI components, complete with pre-built Storybook stories.
- **i18n Translation Support (Coming Soon)**: Add multilingual capabilities to your app effortlessly with i18n integration.
